Custom Discrete PDFs
====================

Ciw allows users to define their own discrete service and inter-arrival time distributions.
An example distribution may look like this:

	+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
	| P(X) |  0.1 |  0.1 |  0.3 |  0.2 |  0.2 |  0.1 |
	+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
	|   X  |  9.5 | 10.2 | 10.6 | 10.9 | 11.7 | 12.1 | 
	+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

This distribution can be defined by a list of lists::

    [[0.1, 9.5], [0.1, 10.2], [0.3, 10.6], [0.2, 10.9], [0.2, 11.7], [0.2, 12.1]]

Here we are saying that the value 9.5 will be sampled with probability 0.1, the value 10.2 will be sampled with probability 0.1, etc. Note that probabilities must sum to 1.

In order to implement this in the parameters dictionary, simply state that that class and node's service distribution is :code:`Custom`, and the distribution as a parameter::

    'Service_distributions':{'Class 0':[['Custom', [[0.1, 9.5], [0.1, 10.2], [0.3, 10.6], [0.2, 10.9], [0.2, 11.7], [0.2, 12.1]]], ['Exponential', 0.1]], 'Class 1':[['Exponential', 0.3], ['Exponential', 0.1]]}

In the :code:`parameters.yml` file, under :code:`Service_distributions`, for the given class and node enter :code:`Custom` and the distribution below it.
An example is shown::

    Service_distributions:
      Class 0:
      - - Custom
        - [[0.1, 9.5], [0.1, 10.2], [0.3, 10.6], [0.2, 10.9], [0.2, 11.7], [0.2, 12.1]]
      - - Exponential
        - 0.1
      Class 1:
      - - Exponential
        - 0.3
      - - Exponential
        - 0.1
